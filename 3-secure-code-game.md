This interactive course is layed out as a game, where you find vulnerabilities in some code.
It currently has 5 levels.

In level 1, you'll learn about a floating-point underflow vulnerability.
You will see the the tests don't pass and you have to figure out how to fix the bug.
Once you do, the tests will pass and you may proceed to the next level.
You'll also learn that it's good practice to limit your system inputs to an acceptable range instead of accepting any value.
Last but not least, get exposed to different ways to handle floating point values.
